  <section>
    <p>Mission-driven product leader and Doctor of Engineering, advancing secure, accountable AI at the intersection of innovation, policy, and public trust.</p>
    <p>At <strong>Microsoft</strong>, I lead strategy for Responsible AI, privacy, and cloud security—most recently shaping <strong>Security Copilot</strong>, the company’s first generative AI security platform. My work accelerates adoption across regulated sectors, enabling government and healthcare organizations to innovate with confidence, compliance, and speed.</p>
    <p>This chapter brought policy and practice together in real time. Insights from <strong>Harvard</strong> and <strong>MIT</strong> directly informed the development of <strong>Microsoft Security Copilot’s</strong> privacy-built-in, secure-by-design, and compliant-by-default capabilities—including the first previewed <strong>Security Agents</strong>—during a defining moment in the evolution of agentic AI.</p>
    <p>Rooted in <strong>U.S. Navy</strong> service and shaped by advanced degrees from <strong>Harvard Kennedy School</strong> and <strong>The George Washington University</strong>, I bring engineering depth and policy fluency to the design of resilient, privacy-aware AI systems aligned with frameworks like FedRAMP, CMMC, EU AI Act, HIPAA, and ISO 42001.</p>
    <p>As an educator and mentor, I translate complex cybersecurity and AI risks into actionable insights—promoting ethical innovation and fostering a culture of accountability across emerging technologies.</p>
