        </div>

        <p>Mission-driven product leader and Doctor of Engineering, shaping the future of secure AI at the intersection of innovation, policy, and public trust.</p>

        <p>At Microsoft, I lead Responsible AI, privacy, and cloud security strategy – most recently guiding Security Copilot, the company’s first generative AI security platform. My work accelerates adoption in highly regulated sectors, empowering government and healthcare organizations to innovate with confidence, compliance, and speed.</p>

        <p>With a foundation forged in U.S. Navy service and advanced degrees from Harvard Kennedy School and The George Washington University, I blend engineering depth with policy fluency to build resilient, privacy-aware AI systems aligned with frameworks such as FedRAMP, HIPAA, and ISO 42001.</p>

        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>I teach graduate-level courses in cybersecurity, AI governance, and cloud compliance to Masters and PhD students at various U.S. universities, including Purdue University, University of the Cumberlands, and University of Arizona Global. My focus is on blending real-world product leadership with academic insights to prepare the next generation of ethical tech leaders.</p>

        <h3>Microsoft</h3>
        <p>At Microsoft, I led product strategy for Security Copilot, the first generative AI-powered security platform. My work focused on responsible AI, privacy, sovereign cloud enablement, and compliance—empowering government and regulated sectors to adopt AI securely. I also led TPM strategy for the Secure Future Initiative within the Cloud Ecosystem Security organization, spanning 10+ products. This high-visibility, cross-org role focused on scaling secure-by-design practices, improving engineering maturity, and aligning security execution with Microsoft’s broader software assurance and AI-readiness goals.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I earned my Doctor and Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity Policy and Engineering Management from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and a Master in Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School, specializing in AI policy and governance. I also cross-registered at MIT to advance research in secure AI systems.</p>

        <h3>U.S. Navy</h3>
        <p>My career began in the U.S. Navy, where I served in strategic and operational roles across the Asia-Pacific. I learned resilience, strategic foresight, and a service-first mindset that continues to shape my leadership style today.</p>
